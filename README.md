NumSpace
A journey through applied mathematics with a machine learning bias.

NumSpace is a work-in-progress repository where mathematical concepts — especially those related to linear algebra — are gradually implemented as they are studied and learned. The focus is on practical exploration and the applicability of these concepts in areas like Machine Learning and other computational applications.

⚠️ Note: This project is in an experimental stage and is not intended for production use. It is designed for learning and experimentation. Contributions, feedback, and ideas are welcome!

Let me know if you’d like further refinements!
